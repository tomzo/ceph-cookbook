## REQUIREMENTS

### Chef

\>= 11.6.0

### Platform

Tested as working:

* Debian Wheezy (7)
* Ubuntu Precise (12.04)
* Ubuntu Trusty (14.04)

### Cookbooks

The ceph cookbook requires the following cookbooks from Chef:

https://supermarket.chef.io/

* [apt](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apt)
* [apache2](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apache2)

## TEMPLATES

## USAGE

Ceph cluster design is beyond the scope of this README, please turn to the
public wiki, mailing lists, visit our IRC channel, or contact Inktank:

http://ceph.com/docs/master
http://ceph.com/resources/mailing-list-irc/
http://www.inktank.com/

This cookbook can be used to implement a chosen cluster design. Most of the configuration is retrieved from node attributes, which can be set by an environment or by a wrapper cookbook. A basic cluster configuration will need most of the following attributes:

* `node['ceph']['config']['fsid']` - the cluster UUID
* `node['ceph']['config]'['global']['public network']` - a CIDR specification of the public network
* `node['ceph']['config]'['global']['cluster network']` - a CIDR specification of a separate cluster replication network
* `node['ceph']['config]'['global']['rgw dns name']` -  the main domain of the radosgw daemon

Most notably, the configuration does _NOT_ need to set the `mon_initial_members`, because the cookbook does a node search to find other mons in the same environment.

The other set of attributes that this recipe needs is `node['ceph']['osd_devices']`, which is an array of OSD definitions, similar to the following:

* {'device' => '/dev/sdb'} - Use a full disk for the OSD, with a small partition for the journal
* {'type' => 'directory', 'device' => '/src/node/sdb1/ceph'} - Use a directory, and have a small file for the journal
* {'device' => '/dev/sde', 'dmcrypt' => true} - Store the data encrypted by passing --dmcrypt to `ceph-disk-prepare`
* {'device' => '/dev/sdc', 'journal' => '/dev/sdd2'} - use a full disk for the OSD with a custom partition for the journal

### Using a Policy Wrapper Cookbook

To automate setting several of these node attributes, it is recommended to use a policy wrapper cookbook. This allows the ability to use Chef Server cookbook versions along with environment version restrictions to roll out configuration changes in an ordered fashion.

It also can help with automating some settings. For example, a wrapper cookbook could peek at the list of harddrives that ohai has found and populate node['ceph']['osd_devices'] accordingly, instead of manually typing them all in:

```ruby
node.override['ceph']['osd_devices'] = node['block_device'].each.reject{ |name, data| name !~ /^sd[b-z]/}.sort.map { |name, data| {'journal' => "/dev/#{name}"} }
```

For best results, the wrapper cookbook's recipe should be placed before the Ceph cookbook in the node's runlist. This will ensure that any attributes are in place before the Ceph cookbook runs and consumes those attributes.

### Ceph Monitor

Ceph monitor nodes should use the ceph-mon role.

Includes:

* ceph::default

### Ceph Metadata Server

Ceph metadata server nodes should use the ceph-mds role.

Includes:

* ceph::default

### Ceph OSD

Ceph OSD nodes should use the ceph-osd role

Includes:

* ceph::default

### Ceph Rados Gateway

Ceph Rados Gateway nodes should use the ceph-radosgw role

## ATTRIBUTES

### General

* `node['ceph']['search_environment']` - a custom Chef environment to search when looking for mon nodes. The cookbook defaults to searching the current environment
* `node['ceph']['branch']` - selects whether to install the stable, testing, or dev version of Ceph
* `node['ceph']['version']` - install a version of Ceph that is different than the cookbook default. If this is changed in a wrapper cookbook, some repository urls may also need to be replaced, and they are found in attributes/repo.rb. If the branch attribute is set to dev, this selects the gitbuilder branch to install
* `node['ceph']['extras_repo']` - whether to install the ceph extras repo. The tgt recipe requires this

* `node['ceph']['config']['fsid']` - the cluster UUID
* `node['ceph']['config']['global']['public network']` - a CIDR specification of the public network
* `node['ceph']['config']['global']['cluster network']` - a CIDR specification of a separate cluster replication network
* `node['ceph']['config']['config-sections']` - add to this hash to add extra config sections to the ceph.conf

* `node['ceph']['user_pools']` - an array of pool definitions, with attributes `name`, `pg_num` and `create_options` (optional), that are automatically created when a monitor is deployed

### Ceph MON

* `node['ceph']['config']['mon']` - a hash of settings to save in ceph.conf in the [mon] section, such as `'mon osd nearfull ratio' => '0.70'`

### Ceph OSD

* `node['ceph']['osd_devices']` - an array of OSD definitions for the current node
* `node['ceph']['config']['osd']` - a hash of settings to save in ceph.conf in the [osd] section, such as `'osd max backfills' => 2`
* `node['ceph']['config']['osd']['osd crush location']` - this attribute can be set on a per-node basis to maintain Crush map locations

### Ceph MDS

* `node['ceph']['config']['mds']` - a hash of settings to save in ceph.conf in the [mds] section, such as `'mds cache size' => '100000'`
* `node['ceph']['cephfs_mount']` - where the cephfs recipe should mount CephFS
* `node['ceph']['cephfs_use_fuse']` - whether the cephfs recipe should use the fuse cephfs client. It will default to heuristics based on the kernel version

### Ceph Rados Gateway

* `node['ceph']['radosgw']['api_fqdn']` - what vhost to configure in the web server
* `node['ceph']['radosgw']['admin_email']` - the admin email address to configure in the web server
* `node['ceph']['radosgw']['rgw_addr']` - the web server's bind address, such as `*:80`
* `node['ceph']['radosgw']['rgw_port']` - if set, connects to the radosgw fastcgi over this port instead of a unix socket
* `node['ceph']['radosgw']['webserver_companion']` - defaults to 'apache2', but it can be set to 'civetweb', or to false in order to leave it unconfigured
* `node['ceph']['radosgw']['path']` - where to save the s3gw.fcgi file
* `node['ceph']['config']['global']['rgw dns name']` -  the main domain of the radosgw daemon, to calculate the bucket name from a subdomain

## Resources/Providers

### ceph\_client

The ceph\_client LWRP provides an easy way to construct a Ceph client key. These keys are needed by anything that needs to talk to the Ceph cluster, including RadosGW, CephFS, and RBD access.

#### Actions

- :add - creates a client key with the given parameters

#### Parameters

- :name - name attribute. The name of the client key to create. This is used to provide a default for the other parameters
- :caps - A hash of capabilities that should be granted to the client key. Defaults to `{ 'mon' => 'allow r', 'osd' => 'allow r' }`
- :as\_keyring - Whether the key should be saved in a keyring format or a simple secret key. Defaults to true, meaning it is saved as a keyring
- :keyname - The key name to register in Ceph. Defaults to `client.#{name}.#{hostname}`
- :filename - Where to save the key. Defaults to `/etc/ceph/ceph.client.#{name}.#{hostname}.keyring` if `as_keyring` and `/etc/ceph/ceph.client.#{name}.#{hostname}.secret` if not `as_keyring`
- :owner - Which owner should own the saved key file. Defaults to root
- :group - Which group should own the saved key file. Defaults to root
- :mode - What file mode should be applied. Defaults to '00640'

### ceph\_cephfs

The ceph\_cephfs LWRP provides an easy way to mount CephFS. It will automatically create a Ceph client key for the machine and mount CephFS to the specified location. If the kernel client is used, instead of the fuse client, a pre-existing subdirectory of CephFS can be mounted instead of the root.

#### Actions

- :mount - mounts CephFS
- :umount - unmounts CephFS
- :remount - remounts CephFS
- :enable - adds an fstab entry to mount CephFS
- :disable - removes an fstab entry to mount CephFS

#### Parameters

- :directory - name attribute. Where to mount CephFS in the local filesystem
- :use\_fuse - whether to use ceph-fuse or the kernel client to mount the filesystem. ceph-fuse is updated more often, but the kernel client allows for subdirectory mounting. Defaults to true
- :cephfs\_subdir - which CephFS subdirectory to mount. Defaults to '/'. An exception will be thrown if this option is set to anything other than '/' if use\_fuse is also true

## Chef-solo

When using chef-solo you must provide configuration which otherwise is fetched from chef-server.
- Set fsid of the ceph cluster - `node['ceph']['config']['fsid']`
- Set other monitor nodes - `node['ceph']['mon_nodes']`
- Set monitor secret - `node['ceph']['monitor-secret']`. You can generate it with
```
ceph-authtool --create-keyring /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring --gen-key -n mon. --cap mon 'allow *'
```
  Then put the output of command below into attribute
```
ceph-authtool /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring --print-key --name=mon.
```
- Set bootstrap osd - `node['ceph']['bootstrap_osd_key']`. You can obtain from a running monitor with
```
ceph auth get-key client.bootstrap-osd
```

### ceph\_pool

The ceph\_pool LWRP provides an easy way to create and delete Ceph pools.

It assumes that connectivity to the cluster is setup and that admin credentials are available from default locations, e.g. /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring.

#### Actions

- :add - creates a pool with the given number of placement groups
- :delete - deletes an existing pool

#### Parameters

- :name - the name of the pool to create or delete
- :pg_num - number of placement groups, when creating a new pool
- :create_options - arguments for pool creation (optional)
- :force - force the deletion of an exiting pool along with any data that is stored in it
